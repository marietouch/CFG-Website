  <h2> So you need a Visa... </h2>
  <p> Depending on where you go for your year abroad, you may find that you need to apply for a student visa. <br />
      If you are an EU citizen who is going to study in Europe, don't worry, this doesn't apply to you. However if you're going to studying outside the EU, you're going to need to apply for a student visa, otherwise they won't let you into the country! </br>
      The application procedures will vary depending on th country, but in most cases you will need to apply online.
