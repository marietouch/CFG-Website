    <h1>While abroad</h1>
    <h2>Here are some recommendations on how to deal with being abroad</h2>

  <h2> Keeping in touch with family and friends who are far away </h2>
  <p> First, here is a time difference guide to help you keep in touch with your family or your fellow abroad friends who are far away: <br/>

    <p> </p>
    Even though they may be far away, don't forget your friends and family will always be there if you need their support.
  </p>
<h2> Language </h2>
<p> If you're abroad in a country which speaks a different language, this can often be a source of frustration or loneliness. There are lots of services you can turn to - there will be additional language classes run by your host institution. <br/>
  Also, you could partner up with an individual who is looking to learn English and have conversation classes where you both get to practice your language.
</p>
<h2> If anything goes wrong... </h2>
<p> Hopefully it won't, but disasters do happen. Where possible, hold on to all your receipts in case youo ever need to claim money back for an expense - such as a health-related expense. <br/>
  If you're in serious trouble, visit the website of your own country's embassy and contact them regarding what you should do. <br/>
  Don't panic! You can always contact UCL's Study Abroad Office and they will help you out in whatever ways they can!
