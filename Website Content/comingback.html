  <h1>Coming Back</h1>
  <h2>Here are some recommendations on how not to feel lost when coming back</h2>

  <p>It may sound surprising, but often when people return from their time abroad they experience reverse culture shock. Hopefully you'll have had such a great time aroad that it will make coming home hard. <br/>
    If you are finding it a bit odd being home again, here are some tips that might help:
    <ul>
      <li> Keeping in touch with your new friends </li>
      <li> Taking care of your mental health </li>
      <li> Tips from other students who went abroad </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<h2> Keeping in touch with friends </h2>
<p> Staying in touch with all the friends you made abroad is a great way to ease the shock of leaving. They'll know what you're going through and so can support you during this time.
</p>
<h2> Taking care of your mental health </h2>
<p> If the adjustment is taking its toll on your mental health, do talk to people about it. Whether it's family or friends, sharing how you're feeling can help and signals to others that you may be struggling. <br/>
  Alternatively, reach out to a professional if your mental health problems persist! <br/>
<h2> Tips from other students </h2>
<p> Don't forget that there are loads of students who have gone through what you're going through now. Reach out to them, ask them how they coped with the transition back to their old life. They may be able to give you some amazing tips!
